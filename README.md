# Foundations-for-Data-Science

This year in the first quarter of 2022, I decided to embark on a challenge to solidify my foundations in data science, after studying two years in learning different concepts in data science.  This decision included using Data Camp as a resources to sweep over the most important concepts in Data Science, many of which I have learned until this point, and ensure I left very few "stones" unturned in solidifying the foundations, before moving on to more complex studies. 

This repository is a base documentation for that process and evolution of that goal.
